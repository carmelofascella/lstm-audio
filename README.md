# LSTM - audio

This repository handles training and exporting the weights of a LSTM model which emulates distorion effects and amplifier circuits. <br>
The network architecture is based on ‘Real-time black-box modelling with recurrent neural networks’ by A. Wright, E.-P. Damskägg, and V. Välimäki.
